Title: About this site

Summary: Site info

This is the personal / professional site of Ben Gras. Personal
because I've started to collect some stuff here that I want to
publish that happens outside my day job; and professional because it
has the side effect of showing myself to prospective clients and
employers. So.. part Facebook, part LinkedIn.
