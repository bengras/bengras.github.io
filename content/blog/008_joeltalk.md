Summary: Dr Joel of RTEMS came to visit the VU University and gave a great talk on Embedded, Realtime, RTEMS and SMP. I made a video of it.

Embedded device.

Interested in embedded systems, real-time systems, or how the
software on satellites or on the Mars rover works, from someone
with many years of experience in this field? Joel has a talk just
for you.

[Joel](http://rtemsramblings.blogspot.com/) from
[RTEMS](http://www.rtems.org/) came to the VU University in Amsterdam
to give a talk. The audience was a big group of [computer systems
researchers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_software) that
aren't necessarily experts in the field of embedded or realtime.

It turns out the audience was perfect for it because the talk is a
great introduction to embedded and realtime; and also goes in-depth
when it comes to the unique challenges in SMP scheduling in that
area.

## We recorded it

My friends at the office Lionel and Kees did audio and video recordings of
it. Joel gave me his slides. I transcribed the whole talk (i.e. subtitles)
to compensate for the audio being crummy in places. My friend Goran boosted
bits of the audio. And I edited it all together.

## Contents briefly

 * What is embedded?
 * What is real-time?
 * What is an operating system?
 * What is an embedded, real-time, operating system?
 * What is RTEMS? Where is it used?
 * RTEMS architecture
 * How are threads managed and scheduled in RTEMS?
 * What changes when we start doing all this in SMP
 * Audience questions

## My favourite part

Is Joel strutting his stuff in response to a question:

> Nobody said these were easy. 
> It's multithreaded, that's why we get the big bucks, right? 

Watch it to see it!
