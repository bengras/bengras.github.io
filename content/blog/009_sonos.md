Summary: 

![Embedded device]({filename}/images/Sonos-company.png)

I'm a Sonos fan.

I'm a big Sonos fan. The devices are quite costly so part of me is
*forced* to be a big Sonos fan. But still I think the abilities,
and quality of the products more than earned my fandom. It's a
perfect home audio speakers solution.

There is always something of course. In my case I occasionally
really want to broadcast some audio from my PC (e.g. an interview
on youtube) throughout my home. Sonos, quite stubbornly I think,
never implemented this (except for suggesting hooking up a PC to
a Sonos component Line-in input). Even though they lately do
offer to stream particular files from a mobile device, which is
close and a really nice feature too.

To anyone looking for this feature - try this pretty slick solution I
found on a [Sonos forum post](https://ask.sonos.com/sonos/topics/allow_sonos_to_monitor_what_computer_is_streaming): install
[streamwhatyouhear](http://www.streamwhatyouhear.com/), make it
do a HTTP stream, and add that HTTP stream as a radio station in your
Sonos controller. Then play that station, and presto. Works really well.
