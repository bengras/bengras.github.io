Summary: I really want to know everything about RTEMS.

My day job is programming Minix. It has been for over 9 years.  I've
come to love it and systems programming in general. I've decided I
want to develop myself further in the field of systems programming.
It seems embedded systems is where commercial value and systems
programming meet, so that is what I want to develop.

My friends Joel Sherril and Chris Johns are core members of the
RTEMS project, a very prestigious Realtime Embedded OS in the sense 
that it runs on highly safety- and reliability-critical systems
from NASA, JPL, ESA, CERN, BMW and many others we do and don't
know about. I'm in contact with them a lot lately in order to
learn more and contribute. RTEMS is the opposite of Minix, and that is a pleasant
change of pace and scenery really.
